<h1>Worlds in the Vicinity</h1>
<p>This list is <i>HIGHLY</i>non-exhaustive, and covers only worlds which the average spacefarer will know of.</p>
<p><b>THERE ARE DOZENS, PERHAPS HUNDREDS MORE.</b></p>
<h2>In the Terran Space Commune</h2>
<div><ul>
    <li>Old Earth, Sol system</li>
    <p>The homeworld of the Terran people.
        A diverse world, it is sometimes inhospitable to other sapients,
        due to having experienced a thermonuclear apocalypse three hundred years ago.
        Known today as a temperate and cool world, thanks to a terraforming process completed about 50 years ago.
    </p>
    <li>Mars, Sol system.</li>
    <p>Nobody's quite sure if the Terrans are serious when they say Mars used to be red.
        The capital of the Space Commune, it is today a highly diplomatic world, despite being rural.
      Mars is cold, and certain quirks of it's orbit mean the terraformation process created a highly unique ecosystem.  
    </p>
    <li>Port Meredith, Alpha Centauri system</li>
    <p>The first extrasolar colony of the Commune. Located in the Alpha Centauri star system.</p>
    <p>Named after the first Terran explorer ship to make landfall, a Torch-class Explorer called the EC Meredith.
       The ship's hull now serves as a musuem in a small town called Meredithia.

    </p>
    <p>Port Meredith is a rural world, with a few large cities and a multitude of smaller towns.</p>
    <p>A notable settlement is Bayard City. Known for it's diverse architecture and large Elven community.</p>
<li>New Uruk, Sirius system</li>
<p>A very urban world, New Uruk is a purpose-built planet of cities and industry.
    The name comes from one of Old Earth's archaeological sites- an early example of Terran urbanisation.
</p>
<li>Pechoukin Frost, Astranin system</li>
<p>A fortress world garrisoning the Matarenese border. Extremely cold.</p>
