<h1>Worlds in the Vicinity</h1>
<p>This list is <i>HIGHLY</i>non-exhaustive, and covers only worlds which the average spacefarer will know of.</p>
<p><b>THERE ARE DOZENS, PERHAPS HUNDREDS MORE.</b></p>
<h2>In the Terran Space Commune</h2>
<div><ul>
    <li>Old Earth</li>
    <p>The homeworld of the Terran people.
        A diverse world, it is sometimes inhospitable to other sapients,
        due to having experienced a thermonuclear apocalypse three hundred years ago.
        Known today as a temperate and cool world, thanks to a terraforming process completed about 50 years ago.
    </p>
    <li>Mars, the Red Planet</li>
    <p>Nobody's quite sure if the Terrans are serious when they say Mars used to be red.
        The capital of the Space Commune, it is today a highly diplomatic world, despite being rural.
      Mars is cold, and certain quirks of it's orbit mean the terraformation process created a highly unique ecosystem.
