    <p><i>The year is Epoch 4237.</i></p>
    <p> For around 70 years, 
        a spacefaring Terran Space Commune 
        has been a member of the Friendship Accord, 
        alongside three fellow spacefaring nations- the Khell'zhak State, the Bohoy Civil Union, and the Indori Serene Nation.
    </p>
<p>Many thousands of years ago, the Galaxy was connected
    by a network of tunnels through a dimension beneath normalspace;
    witchspace. These witchlanes allowed easy traversal, making a years-long journey into weeks.
    Yet, time was not kind, and the Lanes decayed. Today, they cover about 400 square light-years, and around four thousand star systems.
    
</p>
<p>Many of these star systems are rugged and uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Yet in many, there is an abundance of life, of civilisation, and of joy.</p>
