The Terran Star Commune is a nation within the Friendship Accord. It lies to the immediate east of Khellzak, immediately south of Bohoy, and fairly southeasterly of Indoran. To the immediate east, it borders the Matwamian Confederation, and to the northeast it borders the Aapites Federation.

The Commune was established in the year 4152, immediately prior to Terran spacecraft breaching witchlanes to Alpha Centauri and Sirius.
# History

In Epoch Year 4152, Earth is a devastated wasteland. Its people, then known as humanity, are irradiated and struggling. The Great Destruction had wrought immense havoc upon the Earth and its ecosystems, let alone its people.

In 4151, the pre-Commune scientific establishment discovered a layer of spacetime existing underneath realspace. This became known as witchspace, and served as an easy method of travel over long distances. Within the year, small habitation rings had been established across the Terran home system, Sol.

It took until 4155 for the first witchdrive capable spacecraft (that survived) to breach a lane successfully. Due to a bad calculation, which nevertheless served as a lesson, the craft ended up far from home- and expecting to die, was instead met by an equally clueless craft of aliens. The aliens looked like a creature from old Terran folklore known as an elf- tall, and slender, with long ears accentuated to a sharp tip.

The captain of this strange, magical starship explained to the confused Terrans that they, too, were lost in the stars. These elves, though, had an ability the Terrans did not; they had long since accentuated to the latent Veil of witchspace. To the Terrans, this looked for all the world like magic.

First contact was thus made. The two ships were thought lost by their respective homeworlds until a unified effort brought radio back online. The Terran crew roped the Elves into playing a prank, and the two crews contacted the homeworld of the other.
