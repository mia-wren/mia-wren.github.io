<h1>PC building stuff</h1>
<p>Hi! The modern tech industry is capitalistic and horrid. Consumer tech isn't made to last- it's made to fail and force us to sink more money in.</p>
<p>Desktop computers are a great way to subtly resist enshittification and forced obsolescence. They're designed for maintenance over the years, upgrades, and more autonomy.</p>
<p>Even aside from that- they're fun! A computer you can upgrade over the years and develop a hobby around is just plain cool.</p>
