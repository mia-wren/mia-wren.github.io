    The year is Epoch 4192- 2237 Sol date. In Epoch 4155, Sol date 2200, the Terran Star Commune reached for the heavens, and found only friends.
    37 years later, the Terrans are part of something greater; a federal alliance of four member nations known as the Friendship Accord. The Terran Star Commune, the Indori Serene Nation, the Khell'zen State, and the Bohoy Civil Union are united in their goals and dreams.

    The Terran Auxiliary Vessel "Lucent Valentine" is a civilian ship licensed in Terran space. She's old, and she's battered, and her parts come from all over, but she is dearly home to three women and one robot who isn't sure.

    As the crew of the Valentine get embroiled in something far greater than themselves, they find solace only in one another; yet can you ever truly run far enough? Can you ever really make it out the other end?
