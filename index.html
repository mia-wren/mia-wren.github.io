<h1> About me! </h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Mia :-) I'm a 19 year old trans woman- she/her pronouns. 
I've been on estrogen since 12-12-2019.
I'm located in South Africa- my timezone is GMT+2. I am also British, however, so if you see me talking about the UK, that's why!
I'm passionate about open-source tech, history and historiography, Linux, and fantasy literature. 
I'm disabled, with fibromyalgia and medium-support-needs autism, so if I struggle with communication please forgive me!
