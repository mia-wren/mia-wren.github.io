  <h1>Mia McKeown's web presence</h1>
  <p>Hi there! You've reached my homepage :)</p>
  <p>I'm Mia, a systems administrator and total geek. I'm fond of open-source tech, accessibility, historiography, feminism, nice tea... too much to list, really.</p>
  <p>I use she/her pronouns; I'm a trans woman, and have been transitioning for well over half a decade.</p>
  <p>I'm a nerd about many things. I can tell you a lot about Chinese history, more about Linux and Unix-likes generally, and if you want a homelab troubleshooted (troubleshot? i dunno!) I'm your gal.</p>
  <p>Currently I run Arch Linux on a personal desktop, and in the near past I had a small collection of open-source services on the Web- primarily nextcloud and Matrix.</p>
  <p>Ethical computing is important to me, and not just white hat hackin' :P. In recent years the industry of personal computing has become deeply anti-person- it's time we start using these chunks of silicon ethically. We tamed lighting and taught sand to think, and then did evil stuff with it? No thanks!</p>
